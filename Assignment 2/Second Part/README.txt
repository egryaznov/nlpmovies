Make sure that allthree '.json' files (ru-reviews.json, ru-vocab.json, cooked_dataset.json) are in the same directory as the '.py' files, otherwise importing won't work.
You can place all custom reviews into the 'sample-reviews' directory.

The file ru-reviews.json is too large to fit into Moodle, so Iâ€™ve send you an email with assignment submission attachment that contains it. Use rather the e-mailed version.
