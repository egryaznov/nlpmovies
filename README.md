# NLP: Movie Sentiment Classificator
## Assignment Description
In this assignment we were asked to do the following:
1. Write a movie review sentiment classifier using Keras LSTM implementation and IMDB data. This part requires us to understand Keras libraryâ€™s internals, in particular, the layers and how they can be combined with each other. Also we need to know how LSTM networks work
2. Evaluate obtained model against the custom baseline. Here we just need to choose a threshold and show that the final accuracy of our LSTM on test data passes it.
3. Extend the model beyond the given specification and try to get a score over 92%. Here we decided to tackle the same problem but with a little twist: consider a new natural language.
